It provides a form to calculate loan estimations.

## Dependencies

- Backend application needs to be running at `http://localhost:8080`. (https://github.com/raduq/loan)
- Boostrap as styles library

## Getting Started

Run `npm install` to install necessary dependencies

## Development server

Run `npm start` or `ng serve` for a dev server.
Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. 
The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
